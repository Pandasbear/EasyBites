Introduction
  
 
 
We
 
all
 
know
 
that
 
cooking
 
brings
 
people
 
together .
 
In
 
our
 
fast-paced
 
digital
 
world,
 
many
 
people
 
are
 
looking
 
for
 
simple,
 
easy-to-follow
 
recipes
 
that
 
fit
 
their
 
lifestyle
 
and
 
cooking
 
skills.
 
But
 
let's
 
be
 
honest
 
–
 
most
 
existing
 
recipe
 
platforms
 
can
 
feel
 
overwhelming,
 
cluttered,
 
or
 
just
 
plain
 
confusing,
 
especially
 
if
 
you're
 
just
 
starting
 
out
 
in
 
the
 
kitchen.
 
That’ s
 
where
 
EasyBites
 
comes
 
in!
 
We’re
 
creating
 
a
 
clean,
 
beginner -friendly
 
platform
 
where
 
users
 
can
 
easily
 
share
 
and
 
discover
 
recipes
 
that
 
actually
 
work.
 
Our
 
platform
 
will
 
include
 
everything
 
you
 
need:
 
account
 
creation,
 
recipe
 
browsing,
 
recipe
 
posting,
 
and
 
admin
 
moderation.
 
We're
 
designing
 
it
 
specifically
 
to
 
make
 
cooking
 
feel
 
less
 
intimidating
 
and
 
help
 
build
 
a
 
real
 
community
 
of
 
home
 
cooks.
 
On
 
the
 
technical
 
side,
 
we'll
 
be
 
building
 
this
 
web
 
application
 
using
 
HTML5,
 
CSS,
 
JavaScript,
 
and
 
C#,
 
with
 
full
 
CRUD
 
functionality
 
and
 
database
 
integration
 
for
 
storing
 
users,
 
recipes,
 
and
 
feedback.
 
Both
 
user
 
and
 
admin
 
modules
 
will
 
be
 
implemented.
